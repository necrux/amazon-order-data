## How to obtain your data?

As of March 2023 Amazon no longer offers a simple download link to obtain your data. Instead, you must submit a data request through their [privacy central](https://www.amazon.com/gp/privacycentral/dsar/preview.html) portal.

Once the request is submitted, you will need to approve the request via email and wait; Amazon says this waiting period can take a month or longer in some cases.
